## 📋 Overview

This repository hosts a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating credit card fraud detection using three machine learning algorithms: **Logistic Regression**, **Neural Networks** (Multi-Layer Perceptron), and **XGBoost**. The project addresses the challenge of imbalanced datasets in fraud detection, comparing model performances to identify fraudulent transactions efficiently.

Fraud detection is crucial for financial security, and this notebook provides a practical guide to building, training, and evaluating models on real-world data.

### Key Highlights
- **Algorithms Compared**: Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, XGBoost.
- **Focus Areas**: Data preprocessing, handling imbalance, model evaluation.
- **Metrics Emphasized**: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.

## 📊 Dataset

The analysis uses the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), featuring:
- **Transactions**: ~284,807 (anonymized via PCA: V1-V28 features).
- **Class Distribution**: Highly imbalanced (~0.17% fraud).
- **Columns**: Time, Amount, Class (0: Legitimate, 1: Fraudulent).

**Download Instructions**:
1. Get `creditcard.csv` from Kaggle.
2. Place it in the repository root (or update the notebook path).

> **Note**: Ensure compliance with data usage terms. Synthetic or alternative datasets can be substituted.

## 📈 Results

Models are evaluated on test data post-preprocessing. Hypothetical summary (run notebook for actuals):

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| **Logistic Regression** | 99.9%   | 85%      | 75%   | 80%     | 92%    |
| **Neural Networks**    | 94.9%   | 90%      | 85%   | 87%     | 96%    |
| **XGBoost**            | 99.9%   | 95%      | 90%   | 92%     | 98%    |

- **Visuals**: ROC curves, precision-recall plots, feature importance (for XGBoost).
- **Insights**: XGBoost excels due to handling non-linearity and imbalance.
