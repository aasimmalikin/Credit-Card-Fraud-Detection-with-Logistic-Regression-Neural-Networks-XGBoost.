# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-with-Logistic-Regression-Neural-Networks-XGBoost.
Credit Card Fraud Detection
Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of machine learning models for detecting credit card fraud. The notebook explores three popular algorithms: Logistic Regression, Neural Networks (using a multi-layer perceptron), and XGBoost. The primary goal is to compare their performance in handling imbalanced datasets, a common challenge in fraud detection scenarios.
Credit card fraud detection is a critical application in financial security, where the objective is to identify fraudulent transactions from a large volume of legitimate ones. This project uses a publicly available dataset (e.g., from Kaggle) to train and evaluate the models, focusing on metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to account for class imbalance.
Key features of the notebook:

Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Handling class imbalance using techniques like undersampling or SMOTE.
Model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
Visualizations for model performance and feature importance.

Dataset
The notebook utilizes a credit card transaction dataset, typically sourced from Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset. This dataset contains anonymized features (V1 to V28) derived from PCA, along with transaction amount, time, and a binary class label (0 for legitimate, 1 for fraudulent).

Size: Approximately 284,807 transactions.
Imbalance: Highly imbalanced, with fraud cases representing ~0.17% of the data.
Note: If using a different dataset, ensure it follows a similar structure. The notebook assumes the data is in CSV format.

Download the dataset and place it in the project directory as creditcard.csv (or update the file path in the notebook).
Requirements
The notebook is built using Python 3 and requires the following libraries:

NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn (for Logistic Regression, metrics, and preprocessing)
TensorFlow or Keras (for Neural Networks)
XGBoost
Matplotlib and Seaborn (for visualizations)
Imbalanced-learn (for handling class imbalance, optional)

Python version: 3.6+
Installation


Clone the repository:
textgit clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection


Install dependencies using pip:
textpip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Download the dataset (e.g., creditcard.csv) and place it in the root directory.
Open the notebook: Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_with_Logistic_Regression_+_Neural_Networks_+_XGBoost.ipynb.
Run the cells sequentially:

Load and preprocess the data.
Train each model.
Evaluate and compare results.



Example command to run Jupyter:

Mount Google Drive or upload the dataset directly.

Note: Training Neural Networks and XGBoost may require significant computational resources. Consider using GPU acceleration if available.
Notebook Structure
The notebook is organized into the following sections:

Introduction: Overview of credit card fraud detection and the models used.
Data Loading and Exploration: Importing the dataset, EDA (distributions, correlations), and handling missing values.
Preprocessing: Feature scaling, handling imbalance (e.g., via undersampling or oversampling).
Model Implementation:

Logistic Regression: Baseline linear model with sigmoid activation.
Neural Networks: Multi-layer perceptron with hidden layers, trained using backpropagation.
XGBoost: Gradient boosting model with tree-based learners.


Hyperparameter Tuning: Using GridSearchCV or manual tuning.
Evaluation: Confusion matrices, precision-recall curves, ROC-AUC scores.
Comparison and Conclusion: Performance summary and insights.
Visualizations: Plots for model metrics and feature importance.

Results
(Brief summary; refer to the notebook for detailed metrics and plots.)

Logistic Regression: Achieves good accuracy but may struggle with recall on imbalanced data.
Neural Networks: Improves on non-linear patterns; ROC-AUC typically >0.95.
XGBoost: Often the best performer due to ensemble learning; handles imbalance effectively with built-in parameters.

Example metrics (hypothetical; actual results depend on the run):
